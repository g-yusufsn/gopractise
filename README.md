Go is a different language from many perspectives. When compared to some mature languages like C++, Java; this is a totally new language. Here are the things that baffled me when I first encountered;

 * It got its online tour and playground to jump start with the language.
   * [https://play.golang.com](https://play.golang.com)
   * [https://tour.golang.com/welcome/1](https://tour.golang.com/welcome/1)
 * It isn't an object orriented language. There are some language constructs, but nothing to do with OOP.
 * Loosely coupled interfaces. You don't need to know the name of interface. If you have a signature similar to one described
   by interface, you are good to go.
 * Say hi! to slices. Go has something called slice which is essentially a wrapper around a Go array. Resizing is cheap with  slices as you don't allocate new memory if it is within the limits of underlying memory. 
 * It is strongly-typed language, but it has wrappers that can be any type. (interface{})
 * Synchronization is re-imagined with this this language.
